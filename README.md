## Perfect for Midjourney and Stable Diffusion Tiled Images

Tile Wizard is particularly useful for viewing and exploring Midjourney and Stable Diffusion tiled images. These powerful image generation tools often produce complex and intricate tiled patterns that can be difficult to preview and visualize. With Tile Wizard, you can easily view these tiled images in a seamless format and adjust the zoom level to see the details up close. 🔍

## Example Screenshots
