## Why I Built this
I was having so much fun creating new Midjourney v5 images, and I had no good way to test the awesome tiled ones I made!  Enter Tile Wizard, a quick weekend project thanks to GPT-3. 🎉

## Getting Started

You can use Tile Wizard by visiting our [TileWizardApp.com](https://tilewizardapp.com) and following the instructions there. Alternatively, you can download the `index.html` file and open it in your web browser to use Tile Wizard locally. 💻

## Features

- Easy to use: simply upload your tiled background image and view it in a seamless and visually appealing format.
- Lightweight: the entire page is just plain HTML, so it loads quickly and works on all devices.

## Perfect for Midjourney and Stable Diffusion Tiled Images

Tile Wizard is particularly useful for viewing and exploring Midjourney and Stable Diffusion tiled images. These powerful image generation tools often produce complex and intricate tiled patterns that can be difficult to preview and visualize. With Tile Wizard, you can easily view these tiled images in a seamless format and adjust the zoom level to see the details up close. 🔍

## Example Screenshots

Here are a few examples of tiled images generated using Midjourney V5 and Stable Diffusion:
